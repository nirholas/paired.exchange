							paired.exchange is a permissionless launchpad on Robinhood Chain. Anyone can deploy a
							fixed-supply ERC-20 that is priced against one to five tokenized stocks. There is no
							listing process, no allowlist and no approval step.
						</p>
						<p>
							The thing that makes it different from every other launchpad is the quote asset. A
							coin here is not quoted in a stablecoin or in the chain's gas token. It is quoted in
							NVDA, or TSLA, or a split across several of them. Its price, its depth and the fees
							it pays its creator are all denominated in equity.
						</p>
						<Callout>
							The pairing is launch liquidity, not backing. A coin paired with AAPL is not a claim
							on AAPL, is not redeemable for AAPL, and is not an index or a fund.

							Protocol) can browse markets, read coins, price trades and plan a launch for you. Planning is as

							chain at launch, carries an origin block naming the channel, the assistant and the plan, signed by
							the platform attester
							{config?.attester ? (
								<>
									{' '}
									<span className="break-all font-mono text-white/85">{config.attester}</span>

					<Section id="curve" title="How pricing works">
						<p>
							Each pairing gets its own constant-product bonding curve with a virtual quote
							reserve. The virtual reserve is what gives the curve a starting price without anyone
							depositing the stock, which is why a launch costs only the flat fee.
						</p>
						<p>
							Buying moves price up along the curve, selling moves it back down. The two sides are
							symmetric, minus fees. Rounding always favours the pool, so a buy followed
							immediately by a sell returns slightly less than it cost, never more.
						</p>
						<p>
							There is no graduation and no migration. Tokens are sold from the curve
							asymptotically, so price rises without bound and there is never a moment where
							liquidity moves somewhere else. A curve behaves the same on day one and day one
							thousand.
						</p>
						<p>
							Multiple markets do not arbitrage each other automatically. A large buy through one
							pool can leave that market priced differently from the others until someone trades
							the gap.
						</p>
					</Section>

					<Section id="fees" title="Fees">
						<Table
							rows={[
								['Launch fee', 'Flat, in ETH', 'Protocol treasury, once at launch'],
								['Swap fee', 'Taken from the quote side of every trade', 'Split below'],
								['Creator share', '70% of swap fees', 'The coin creator'],
								['Protocol share', '30% of swap fees', 'Protocol treasury'],
							]}
						/>
						<p>
							Fees accrue in the asset each pool quotes. A coin paired with NVDA earns its creator
							NVDA. Claiming is one transaction for every asset at once, not one per asset.
						</p>
						<p>
							The fee recipient can be moved by whoever currently holds it, so rotating wallets or
							handing a project to a DAO does not cost you the revenue. Fees already accrued stay
							with whoever earned them.

						<p>
							Getting gas onto the chain is the only fiddly step. It is an Arbitrum Orbit chain, so
							the canonical bridge runs from Ethereum L1 and costs more in L1 gas than most people

							Two contracts, no external dependencies, no proxy. The launchpad holds the curves and
							the fee accounting. Each coin is a plain fixed-supply ERC-20 with no mint function, no
							owner, no pause and no upgrade path: the supply at construction is the supply forever,
							and the launchpad holds no privilege over a token it created.
						</p>
						<p>
							The owner key can change the launch fee, the swap fee and the quote registry. The swap
							fee is capped in code at 5%, so the key cannot be used to expropriate traders.
