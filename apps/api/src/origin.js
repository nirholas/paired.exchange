// Launch provenance.
//
// A coin planned by an assistant over MCP carries an `origin` block in its
// descriptor: which channel it came from, which draft, and a signature from the
// platform's attester key over the fields that matter. The keccak of the
// descriptor's exact bytes is committed on chain at launch, so the origin is
// bound to the coin forever and anyone can check it without trusting this
// server's database: recover the signer of `originMessage(...)` and compare it
// with the attester published at /api/config.
//
// The launchpad contract is immutable, so this lives in the descriptor rather
// than in an event. The descriptor is the one place a launch already commits
// arbitrary, hash-pinned data.
