# paired-mcp

Launch coins paired with tokenized stocks on Robinhood Chain from any MCP
client. This is a stdio bridge to the hosted [paired.exchange](https://github.com/nirholas/paired.exchange)
MCP server: tools are discovered from the server at startup, so the package
never falls behind the live tool set.

The assistant can browse markets and coins, price trades and plan a launch.
It cannot sign. `plan_launch` returns a link; you open it, connect your own
wallet, review, and sign. Nothing is deployed or spent until you do.

## Use it

Clients that take a remote URL (Claude on the web and desktop via Settings,
Connectors, Add custom connector; Claude Code) do not need this package:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http paired https://paired.exchange/mcp
```

Clients that start servers over stdio:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paired": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "paired-mcp"] }
  }
}
```

`PAIRED_MCP_URL` points the bridge at a different deployment.

## Example

> Launch a coin called Chip Dip, ticker CHIPS, 70% NVDA and 30% AMD, with this
> logo: https://example.com/chips.png

The assistant calls `plan_launch`, shows the summary and the link, and after
you sign, `launch_status` returns the coin address.
